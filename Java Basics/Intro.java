// Java is popular programming language
// It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.

// It is used for:
// Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
// Desktop applications
// Web applications
// Web servers and application servers
// Games
// Database connection
// And much, much more!

// Why Use Java?
// Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
// It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
// It has a large demand in the current job market
// It is easy to learn and simple to use
// It is open-source and free
// It is secure, fast and powerful
// It has huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
// Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
// As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa

// Boilerplate
// In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.
//
// public class Intro {
//   public static void main(String[] args){ // main is starting point of every java program

//   }
// }

// Java Example
public class Intro {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String name = "Piyush";
    System.out.println("Hello " + name) // println() method to print a line of text to the screen:
  }
}

// Statements
// A computer program is a set of "instructions" to be exceuted by a computer.
// In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

// Example
// System.out.println("Hello, World");

// It is important that we end the statement with a semicolon ;.
// If you forget the semicolon (;), an error will occur and the program will not run: error: ';' expected

// The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written
